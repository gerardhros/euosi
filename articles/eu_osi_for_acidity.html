</h3>
<p>Soil pH is one of the most fundamental indicators of soil health, as
it governs the chemical environment in which roots and soil organisms
function. It directly affects nutrient solubility, microbial activity,
and soil structure. In acidic soils, key nutrients such as phosphorus,
calcium, and magnesium become less available, while toxic elements like
aluminum and manganese can reach harmful concentrations. In alkaline
soils, micronutrients such as zinc, iron, and manganese often become
deficient. Within Europe, soil pH varies widely: acidic soils dominate
in Northern and Western Europe due to high rainfall and leaching, while
calcareous soils are more common in Mediterranean and Central regions.
Because most crops perform optimally within a moderately acidic to
neutral pH range (approximately 5.5–7.0), soil pH is a central parameter
in assessing soil health and guiding liming or amendment strategies.</p>
<p>In agricultural soils, acidification is caused by the application of
acidifying fertilisers, nitrate leaching, nutrient uptake (affecting
cation/anion balance) by plants, N fixation in legumes, plant root
exudates and the mineralisation of soil organic matter. Soil
acidification, defined as a decrease in the acid neutralisation capacity
of the soil is a major issue all around the world. In calcareous soils
with a high natural buffer capacity, there is little concern, as the pH
remains stable and slightly alkaline until all carbonates are depleted.
This depletion depends on their dissolution rate. However, in
non-calcareous soils, with a low buffer capacity, especially sandy soils
with low organic matter content, soil acidification may cause a
relatively fast decline in soil pH and base saturation. Agronomic
measures such as the addition of manure and lime mitigate the impact of
soil acidification, thereby preventing a decline in soil pH.</p>
<p>The base cation saturation reflects the proportion of the soil’s
cation exchange sites occupied by calcium (Ca²⁺), magnesium (Mg²⁺),
potassium (K⁺), and sodium (Na⁺), relative to acidic cations such as
hydrogen (H⁺) and aluminum (Al³⁺). High base saturation generally
indicates a fertile, well-buffered soil with good nutrient availability,
while low base saturation is associated with acidity, nutrient
deficiencies, and reduced biological activity. The balance among
individual cations is also important: adequate Ca and Mg support soil
aggregation and root development, while excessive K relative to Mg and
Ca can impair nutrient uptake and plant health. In European soil health
assessments, base cation saturation is used not only to evaluate
nutrient availability but also as a longer-term indicator of soil
resilience, buffering capacity, and the effectiveness of liming
practices.</p>

<h3 id="measurement-and-evaluation">Measurement and evaluation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#measurement-and-evaluation"></a>
</h3>
<p>Soil pH is typically measured in water (pH-H₂O) or in a salt solution
such as 0.01 M CaCl₂, the latter giving more stable readings and widely
used across Europe in soil testing laboratories. Base cation saturation
is determined through extraction of exchangeable cations, commonly with
ammonium acetate or barium chloride, followed by quantification using
atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) or inductively coupled plasma (ICP)
techniques. Results are expressed as percentages of the cation exchange
capacity (CEC).</p>
<p>For crop production, evaluation relies on both absolute pH values and
base saturation levels. In much of Northern Europe, where soils are
naturally acidic, liming is a common management practice to raise pH,
increase base saturation, and improve nutrient availability. In
Mediterranean regions, where soils often have naturally high pH and Ca
saturation, management focuses more on maintaining micronutrient
availability. European guidelines typically recommend maintaining soil
pH within crop-specific optimal ranges (for example, 6.0–6.5 for cereals
and oilseed rape, slightly lower for potatoes, and slightly higher for
legumes and sugar beet). Similarly, base saturation thresholds are used
to guide liming and fertilization: values above 70–80% are generally
considered favorable for most crops, while low saturation indicates the
need for corrective amendments.</p>

</h3>
<p>The European Open Soil Index assesses the soil pH and buffering
capacity using the agronomic knowledge base as being used in the various
EU countries. The soil function is transformed into an unitless
indicator score ranging between zero (poor quality) and one (optimum
quality). This indicator score reflects the ‘distance to target’
(i.e. difference between the current and optimum situation, while
ensuring that other soil functions are not limiting). The further it
deviates from score 1, the poorer the soil function works. An indicator
value of 0.5 approximately corresponds to the lower threshold level of
the fertilization guidelines under which (additional) fertilization is
recommended (given the ‘buildup and maintenance’ approach as being
implemented in fertilizer recommendation systems). Overall, the
indicator value can be interpreted as good (&gt;0.75), sufficient
(0.5-0.75), and poor (&lt;0.5).</p>

</h2>
<p>In euso package has a wrapper function to assess the soil health
index for the soil pH and associated buffer capacity in agricultural
soils across Europe. The wrapper function is <code>osi_c_ph</code> and
has the following inputs:</p>
<ul>
<li>B_LU (character) The crop code</li>
<li>B_SOILTYPE_AGR (character) The soil type in a particular region</li>
<li>A_CLAY_MI (numeric) The clay content of the soil (%)</li>
<li>A_SAND_MI (numeric) The sand content of the soil (%)</li>
<li>A_SOM_LOI (numeric) The organic matter content of the soil (%)</li>
<li>A_C_OF (numeric) The organic carbon content in the soil (g C /
kg)</li>
<li>A_PH_WA (numeric) The pH measured in water.</li>
<li>A_PH_CC (numeric) The pH measured in CaCl2 extraction.</li>
<li>A_PH_KCL (numeric) The pH measured in KCL extraction.</li>
<li>A_CA_CO_PO (numeric) The exchangeable Ca-content of the soil

</ul>
<p>Not all the inputs are mandatory. The function runs with the soil
parameters being available for LUCAS. Other properties, when unknown,
can be estimated from published pedotransferfunctions, using the
function <code>osi_conv_ph</code>,<code>osi_conv_som</code>, and
<code>osi_conv_magnesium</code>.</p>
<p>Note that the IACS crop codes codes have been added to the
<code>osi_crops</code> package table from version 0.4.0 onwards. The
crop codes are only present for the countries AT, BE, BG, CZ, DE, DK,
ES, FI, FR, IT, NL, PT, SE, and SK.</p>
<p>The wrapper function wraps country specific soil health functions

<h3 id="austria-at">Austria (AT)<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#austria-at"></a>
</h3>
<p>Austrian agronomic guidance treats active soil pH (measured in the
lab, usually H₂O or CaCl₂) as the primary diagnostic for lime needs and
crop suitability; buffer or reserve acidity methods are used to estimate
lime requirement together with soil texture and organic matter. Target
pH ranges are crop-specific (e.g., cereals and grass close to neutral),
and practical liming recommendations consider the soil’s buffering
capacity so lime rates are matched to texture and OM to reach and
maintain target pH. Base cation saturation (Ca, Mg, K, Na as % of CEC)
is used mainly to check long-term fertility and structural implications
(Ca:Mg balance for aggregate stability). Local chamber-of-agriculture
and extension material summarise these principles and stress regular
soil testing (every 3–5 years) to guide liming.</p>
<p>Soil pH is measured in CaCl2 whereas the soil pH assessment depends
on texture class and crop (see
<code>National Richtlinien für die sachgerechte Düngung</code>). The
base saturation (with calcium, magnesium and potassium) is sometimes
reported but not primary for farmer advice.</p>
<p>The function to assess soil acidity in the euosi package is called
<code>osi_c_ph_at</code> and requires the following inputs:</p>
<ul>
<li>B_LU, being the crop code, an unique number for each crop</li>
<li>A_PH_CC, being the soil pH measured with calcium chloride.</li>
<li>B_TEXTURE_HYPRES, being the soil texture class according to HYPRES
classification system</li>
</ul>
<p>The soil pH assessment differs per soil type, adopted via the HYPRES
soil texture classification. Based on the soil mineralogy (clay, sand
and silt content) one can classify the HYPRES texture class using
<code>osi_get_TEXTURE_HYPRES</code>.</p>
<p>Note that the IACS crop codes codes have been added to the
<code>osi_crops</code> package table in version 0.4.0.</p>
<p>Below we illustrate how the soil health index varies in response to
variation in the soil pH for three soil types differing in soil texture,
and a pH ranging from 3 to 7.</p>

<h3 id="belgium-be">Belgium (BE)<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#belgium-be"></a>
</h3>
<p>Belgian soil-health and agronomy guidance follows European practice:
soil pH is measured in laboratory conditions (water or a salt solution)
and used to decide liming; lime requirement is derived from pH plus
buffering indicators (texture/OM). National and regional advisory bodies
incorporate pH and exchangeable cation analyses (usually extracted with
ammonium acetate) into soil reports; results are interpreted with
crop-specific target pH ranges and with attention to Ca:Mg and K:Mg
ratios to avoid imbalances that affect structure and uptake. Belgian
research/extension literature and soil-quality projects emphasise
site-specific testing because of strong local variability (peaty/sandy
pockets needing different approaches).</p>
<p>In Flanders, soil analysis reports pH-KCl and exchangeable cations;
Wallonia uses pH-water. the soil health indicator for soil acidity need
assessed by soil type, target pH, and sometimes the base cation balance.
Recommended thresholds for pH-KCl varies for sandy soils between
5.5–6.0, for loam soils between 6.0–6.5, and for clay soils above 6.5.
Sugar beet and alfalfa require pH values higher than 6.5–7.0. Where
levels of Magnesium is low, dolomitic lime is recommended to increase
the CEC occupation with magnesium.</p>
<p>The function to assess soil acidity in the euosi package is called
<code>osi_c_ph_be</code> and requires the following inputs:</p>
<ul>
<li>B_LU, being the crop code, an unique number for each crop</li>
<li>A_PH_KCL, being the soil pH measured with potassium chloride.</li>
<li>B_TEXTURE_BE, being the soil texture class according to Belgium
classification system</li>

<p>The soil pH assessment differs per soil type, adopted via the Belgium
soil texture classification. Based on the soil mineralogy (clay, sand
and silt content) one can classify the Belgium texture class using
<code>osi_get_TEXTURE_BE</code>.</p>
<p>Note that the IACS crop codes codes have been added to the
<code>osi_crops</code> package table in version 0.4.0.</p>
<p>Below we illustrate how the soil health index varies in response to
variation in the soil pH for three soil types differing in soil texture,

<h3 id="switzerland-ch">Switzerland (CH)<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#switzerland-ch"></a>
</h3>
<p>Swiss practice (Agroscope guidance and national fertiliser
recommendations) uses standard laboratory pH measurement (water and
buffer/indicator tests where needed) and exchangeable cations
(ammonium-acetate extraction) to calculate base saturation and CEC.
Switzerland evaluates liming needs relative to crop targets and soil
buffering capacity; liming recommendations are routinely integrated into
national fertiliser/advice documents and calibrated with field yield
data, particularly for high-value arable and forage systems. Base
saturation is used as a diagnostic of long-term base status and recovery
after acidification (for example in regions historically affected by
acid deposition), with management focusing on restoring Ca and Mg levels
to support structure and root growth.</p>
<p>Soil pH measured in water; the Swiss Fertilizer Guidelines (PRIF) set
targets by soil texture and crop. Base saturation is determined in soil
surveys and forest soil monitoring but not central to farm-level
advice.Target pH for mineral soils varies between 6.2–6.8, and for
organic soils between 5.5–6.0. High-demand crops (clover, beet) require
pH levels above 6.5.</p>
<p>The function to assess soil acidity in the euosi package is called
<code>osi_c_ph_ch</code> and requires the following inputs:</p>
<ul>
<li>B_LU, being the crop code, an unique number for each crop</li>
<li>A_CLAY_MI, being the clay content (%)</li>
<li>A_PH_WA, being the soil pH measured in a water extract.</li>
<li>A_CA_CO_PO, being the extracted Ca content with Cohex, unit

<li>A_MG_CO_PO, being the extracted Mg content with Cohex, unit
percentage occupation of the CEC (%)</li>
<li>A_K_CO_PO, being the extracted K content with Cohex, unit percentage
occupation of the CEC (%)</li>
<li>A_NA_CO_PO, being the extracted Na content with Cohex, unit
percentage occupation of the CEC (%)</li>
</ul>
<p>The soil pH assessment is based on the combined assessment of the
base saturation (evaluation 1) and the pH in view of an optimum pH
target value differing for clayey and sandy soils (evaluation 2).</p>
<p>Note that the IACS crop codes codes have been added to the
<code>osi_crops</code> package table in version 0.4.0.</p>
<p>Below we illustrate how the soil health index varies in response to
variation in the soil pH for three soil types differing in soil texture,

</h3>
<p>Czech agronomic practice centres on laboratory soil pH (often in
CaCl₂) and exchangeable bases determined by standard extractions;
national monitoring and advisory frameworks use these data within an
agrochemical testing programme to generate liming and fertiliser advice.
Liming is recommended where pH and base saturation fall below
crop-specific thresholds, and long-term monitoring (national soil
surveys and forest/field studies) informs regional liming programmes.
Guidance emphasises both immediate pH correction and the need to address
the causes of acidification (e.g., long-term N-use and leaching) to
maintain base saturation and prevent aluminium toxicity in sensitive
soils.</p>
<p>The soil pH is usually measured in water. The soil assessment is
based on the pH and accounts for soil textural differences and crop
requirements. The base saturation is not commonly used. Optimal pH
ranges for various crops are provided in national guidelines, with with
specific recommendations for sensitive crops like sugar beet and
vegetables. Liming is advised when pH falls below crop-specific
thresholds.</p>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="germany-de">Germany (DE)<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#germany-de"></a>
</h3>
<p>German practice treats soil pH (measured both in water and in KCl or
CaCl₂ solutions) and exchangeable bases (extracted typically with
ammonium acetate) as core diagnostics for liming and nutrient
management. Laboratories report CEC and base saturation (% of CEC
occupied by Ca, Mg, K, Na) and many advisory services use crop-specific
target pH ranges (often near neutral for arable crops) and minimum base
saturation guidance to determine lime need and corrective fertiliser.
Liming recommendations are adjusted by soil texture and organic matter
because these control buffering capacity; in forest and grassland
contexts regional monitoring also targets recovery of base saturation
following past acid deposition.</p>
<p>Soil pH typically measured in CaCl2. The soil pH assessment and
associate lime requirement is derived from current pH
vs. soil-type-specific optimum, while accounting for soil properties
controlling the buffer capacity such as clay and soil organic matter.
The base saturation is also used in diagnostic soil chemistry and humus
evaluation, but not for the assessment of soil acidity. According to the
<code>VDLUFA Handbuch der Landwirtschaftlichen Versuche</code> and state
fertilization guides, optimal pH-CaCl2 ranges for sandy soils between
5.0–5.5, for loamy soils between 6.0–6.5, and for clay soils at values
higher than 6.5. Liming is advised when pH falls 0.2–0.3 units below the
target.</p>
<p>The function to assess soil acidity in the euosi package is called
<code>osi_c_ph_de</code> and requires the following inputs:</p>
<ul>
<li>B_LU, being the crop code, an unique number for each crop</li>

<h3 id="denmark-dk">Denmark (DK)<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#denmark-dk"></a>
</h3>
<p>Danish guidance emphasizes routine laboratory measurement of soil pH
(typically both pH in water and pH in a CaCl2) and quantification of
exchangeable bases to calculate CEC and base saturation. Because Danish
soils vary from marine clays to sandy, leached soils, interpretation is
strongly soil-type specific: coastal and clay soils are often base-rich
while sandy soils can be acidified and require more frequent liming.
Liming advice in Denmark couples target pH ranges for particular crops
with buffer- or reserve-acidity approaches to calculate lime rates
(taking texture and organic matter into account) and pays special
attention to regional maps and monitoring to prioritize areas for
corrective liming.</p>
<p>In production terms, advisers in Denmark use pH and base saturation
both to protect yields (ensure macronutrient availability and avoid Al
toxicity) and to maintain soil structure—high Ca saturation is tied to
aggregate stability on heavier soils while Mg and the Ca:Mg balance are
monitored to avoid structural or uptake problems. Liming is therefore
treated as both an agronomic and an environmental management tool (e.g.,
to reduce N losses and sustain productive grass and arable systems).</p>
<p>Soil reaction is managed via reaktionstal (Rt), closely related to pH
CaCl2 (approx. Rt ≈ pH+0.5). Soil pH assessment depends on soil texture
and crop sensitivity; base saturation is not used in routine Danish
recommendations. SEGES materials outline optimal Rt bands that increase
with clay content and for sensitive crops; advisory notes emphasize
maintaining Rt near the soil- and crop-specific optimum to secure P, K,
Mg availability and structure. More information can be found <a href="https://silo.seges.dk/media/33qadkue/goedningslaere.pdf" class="external-link">here</a>.</p>

</h3>
<p>Estonian soil guidance focuses on pH measured in the laboratory
(commonly pH in KCl for mineral soils) and on exchangeable bases to
calculate base saturation and CEC. Because large areas of Estonian
arable land include podzolic and peaty soils, monitoring pHKCl and base
saturation helps to identify soils requiring correction liming versus
routine maintenance liming. National practice typically recommends
correction where pHKCl drops below established thresholds (maintenance
programs recommend re-liming every few years on acid-prone soils) and
factors lime rates by texture and organic matter to account for
buffering capacity.</p>
<p>For crop production, Estonian advisers use pH and base saturation to
avoid Al toxicity and to secure Ca and Mg supplies for root growth and
aggregate stability; sandy and low-organic soils are prioritized because
they lose bases most rapidly. Crop-specific pH targets are used to set
liming priorities, with special attention to grassland and fodder crops
where forage quality and animal health (e.g., grass tetany risk) depend
on balanced bases.</p>
<p>National guidance uses pH measured in 1 M KCl (pH-KCl). The soil
acidity is evaluated from pHKCl together with texture and soil organic
matter. The base saturation is generally not part of routine advice. The
<a href="https://metk.agri.ee/sites/default/files/documents/2024-07/Vaetamise_ABC.pdf" class="external-link"><code>Väetamise ABC</code></a>
states optimal pH-KCl varying between 6.0–6.7 for most arable soils
whereas liming is recommended below this range, with stricter targets
for sensitive crops and finer textures.</p>

<p>Greek soil assessment for pH and base saturation is regionally
differentiated because soils range from calcareous Mediterranean soils
(often naturally alkaline and base-rich) to more acidic mountainous and
upland soils. Standard laboratory pH measurement (often water and
sometimes CaCl2) and exchangeable cation analysis (e.g., ammonium

calcareous lowlands the emphasis is typically not on liming but on
managing micronutrient availability (Fe, Zn, Mn) at higher pH, whereas
in upland or leached soils liming is recommended where pH and base
saturation fall below crop-specific thresholds. In crop-management
terms, Greek advisers therefore interpret pH and base saturation in a
landscape context: in many Mediterranean cropping systems the priority
is to avoid induced micronutrient deficiencies at high pH, while in
acid-prone mountain soils the priority is to restore bases to prevent Al
toxicity and improve structure for root growth. Lime recommendations are
adjusted for soil texture and the carbonate status of the parent

<p>Spain uses routine pH measurements (usually water or KCL) and
sometimes exchangeable base analyses to assess soil acidity and liming
requirements. The interpretation has strongly regional differences. Much
of Spain’s agricultural land is calcareous and already base-rich, so
many Iberian guidance documents focus on managing micronutrient
availability at high pH and on adjusting fertiliser practice for
calcareous conditions. In Atlantic and northern regions with more acidic
soils, liming recommendations follow the standard approach—measuring pH,
assessing buffering capacity and using crop-specific pH targets. For
Spanish crop production, pH and base saturation are therefore used
either to identify a need for liming (northern, leached soils; uplands)
or to manage micronutrients and phosphorus availability in calcareous
soils. Recommendations account for soil texture, organic matter and the
high spatial variability typical of Mediterranean landscapes.</p>

<p>Finnish guidance uses laboratory pH (usually water) and exchangeable
base measurements to report CEC and base saturation. Because Finland has
a large area of acidified podzols and organic soils, national advisory
practice emphasizes regular soil testing and systematic liming
programmes on acid-prone mineral soils and maintenance liming on peat
and drained peat soils with crop-specific pH targets. Lime requirement
is calculated using buffer or reserve-acidity approaches adapted to
local textures and organic matter content so that doses match the soil’s
buffering capacity.From a crop-production perspective, Finland treats
liming as essential where pH and base saturation limit nutrient
availability or promote Al toxicity—especially for grass and cereal
systems—and lime is recommended to sustain yields, improve soil
structure and reduce the agronomic and environmental impacts of
acidification.</p>
<p>The main principle of soil health assessment is based on pH-water,
where the evaluation differs among soil texture classes and the organic
matter content. The base saturation is not commonly used in routine
advisory services. Optimal pH ranges for various crops are provided in
national guidelines, with specific recommendations for sensitive crops

extractions) into routine soil reports used by agronomists and advisers.
France spans many soil types, so national guidance uses crop-specific
target pH bands and base saturation indicators; liming advice is based
on buffer-based lime requirement tests or lookup tables that account for
texture and organic matter. French extension and research organisations
also emphasize the balance among Ca, Mg and K because it affects
structure and nutrient uptake, and liming is used both to restore
productive capacity and to address environmental goals such as reducing
N losses where pH constrains nitrification.</p>
<p>In practice, French advisers treat pH and base saturation as core
diagnostics for both arable and perennial systems; on calcareous areas
the emphasis shifts to micronutrient and P management, while in more
leached parts liming to raise base saturation and avoid Al toxicity is
routine. The soil pH is usually determined in a water extract where the
soil health assesment accounts for differences in texture and soil
organic matter content. Recommended pH ranges vary by region and crop
type. For instance, in the Loire Valley, optimal pH for cereals is
around 6.0–6.5. Liming is recommended when pH is below these optimal

<p>Slovenian soil fertility practice measures pH (water/CaCl₂) and
exchangeable cations, using base saturation and CEC values to steer
liming and nutrient management. Because of varied topography and a mix
of calcareous and acid soils, national guidance emphasizes site-specific
testing and crop-based pH targets; calcareous regions require different
approaches than acid mountain soils where liming is often needed to
restore base saturation.</p>
<p>In Slovenia the soil pH is usually determined in water. The soil
health assessment accounts for soil texture and crop requirement. Liming
guidelines and soil test interpretation documentation has not yet been
found, so the euosi R package has not yet a function for SK
implemented.</p>

<p>UK practice (extension, agronomy guides and national labs) uses pH
measurements (water and SMP or CaCl₂) and exchangeable base analysis to
calculate CEC and base saturation; lime requirement is commonly
calculated from SMP or buffer methods and look-up tables that account
for soil texture and organic matter. Target pH bands are crop-specific
(e.g. 6.0–6.5 for many arable crops, 6.3 for grassland) and advisers
monitor base saturation to ensure adequate Ca and Mg and to avoid
excessive K:Mg imbalances; farm liming plans and incremental maintenance
liming are standard recommendations.</p>
<p>The soil health assessment accounts for soil texture and crop
requirement. Liming is recommended when pH is below these optimal
ranges. More information can be found in the fertilizer guidelines
provided by AHDB, being found <a href="https://ahdb.org.uk/knowledge-library/soil-ph-and-liming-recommendations-for-arable-and-grass-systems" class="external-link">here</a>.</p>
<p>The function to assess soil acidity in the euosi package is called
<code>osi_c_ph_uk</code> and requires the following inputs:</p>
<ul>
<li>B_LU, being the crop code, an unique number for each crop</li>
<li>A_SOM_LOI, being the soil organic matter content, in units
percentage (%)</li>
<li>A_PH_WA, being the soil pH measured in a water extract.</li>
</ul>
<p>The soil pH assessment differs between mineral and organic soils
following the SOM content measured. The soil pH assessment is based on
the assessment of pH with optimum treshold varying per crop. Below an
example how the soil pH assessment is evaluated in the
<code>euosi R package</code> for both mineral and organic soil types and
a pH value ranging from 4 to 8.</p>

<p>More vignettes will be made available regarding the derivation of all
soil health indicators, the aggregation methods applied, the derivation
of optimum land use given the current soil quality assessments, and the
best management practices to be applied to improve the soil quality. See
