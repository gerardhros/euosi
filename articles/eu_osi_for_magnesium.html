</h3>
<p>Magnesium (Mg) is an essential macronutrient for plants, best known
as the central atom in the chlorophyll molecule, making it vital for
photosynthesis and energy transfer. Beyond this, Mg plays a role in
enzyme activation, protein synthesis, and carbohydrate partitioning,
which are all critical for crop productivity. In a soil health context,
Mg is not only important as a nutrient but also as a structural
component influencing soil chemistry. As a divalent cation, Mg
contributes to cation exchange capacity (CEC) and helps stabilize soil
aggregates. Its balance with calcium (Ca) and magnesium (K) strongly
influences soil structure, nutrient availability, and root development.
In Europe, where many soils are derived from calcareous or base-rich
parent materials, Mg is often adequate, but deficiencies can still
occur, particularly in sandy soils, acidic soils, and areas with high
rainfall that promote leaching.</p>
<p>Soil magnesium is typically measured through laboratory analysis of
the exchangeable cation pool. Standard extraction methods in Europe
include ammonium acetate (pH 7) or calcium chloride solutions, which
release Mg from cation exchange sites for quantification, usually via
atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) or inductively coupled plasma (ICP)
analysis. The results are expressed in mg Mg per kg of soil or as
milliequivalents per 100 g of soil. In some European soil health
frameworks, Mg is also evaluated in relation to other cations, with
particular attention to the Ca:Mg and K:Mg ratios. These ratios are seen
as indicative of potential nutrient imbalances that could affect both
soil physical properties and crop uptake efficiency.</p>
<p>In the context of European agriculture, magnesium availability is
assessed against critical thresholds for specific crops and soil types.
Deficiencies are most problematic in light-textured soils, where Mg can
be leached below the rooting zone, and in regions with acidic soils
where exchangeable Mg is low. Crops with high Mg demand, such as
potatoes, sugar beet, and certain cereals, are particularly sensitive to
shortages. Soil test values below critical limits often trigger
recommendations for Mg fertilization, either through liming materials
that contain magnesium (e.g., dolomitic lime) or direct application of
soluble Mg fertilizers such as kieserite (magnesium sulfate). Evaluation
is also linked to soil pH and organic matter content, as both factors
influence Mg retention and availability. In practice, soil Mg status is
considered alongside nitrogen, phosphorus, and magnesium to ensure
balanced nutrition, with deficiency posing risks to both yield and crop
quality, particularly in dairy systems where Mg deficiency in forage can
lead to animal health problems such as grass tetany.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://gerardhros.github.io/euosi/">European Open Soil
Index</a> assesses the soil function for Mg supply using the agronomic
knowledge base as being used in the various EU countries. The soil Mg
supply is transformed into an unitless indicator score ranging between
zero (poor quality) and one (optimum quality). This indicator score
reflects the ‘distance to target’ (i.e. difference between the current
and optimum situation, while ensuring that other soil functions are not
limiting). The further it deviates from score 1, the poorer the soil
function works. An indicator value of 0.5 approximately corresponds to
the lower threshold level of the fertilization guidelines under which
(additional) fertilization is recommended (given the ‘buildup and
maintenance’ approach as being implemented in fertilizer recommendation
systems). Overall, the indicator value can be interpreted as good
(&gt;0.75), sufficient (0.5-0.75), and poor (&lt;0.5).</p>

to estimate <code>A_C_OF</code>,<code>A_PH_WA</code>, and
<code>A_CEC_CO</code> when value is missing (i.e. NA_real_).</p>
<p>Note that the IACS crop codes codes have been added to the
<code>osi_crops</code> package table from version 0.4.0 onwards. The
crop codes are only present for the countries AT, BE, BG, CZ, DE, DK,
ES, FI, FR, IT, NL, PT, SE, and SK.</p>
<p>The wrapper function wraps country specific Mg assessment functions.
These are illustrated and described in this vignette per country, sorted

<p>The soil Mg threshold for optimum soil health is in Austria generic
for all soil types but differs between arable land and grassland. More
information can be found in the article of Bohner et al. (2013), that
can be downloaded <a href="https://raumberg-gumpenstein.at/jdownloads/Forschungsberichte/Umweltressourcen_im_Gruenland/Naehrstoffe/2_2013_INTERREG_IV_Projekt_Abschlussbericht_gewaesserzukunft_Bohner.pdf" class="external-link">here</a>

<p>The optimum soil Mg threshold is around 90-100 mg Mg/kg whereas
occurance of Mg deficiencies might vary depending on soil type.
Magnesium deficiency symptoms start to occur when Mg-CaCl2 becomes lower
than 60 mg Mg/kg for the clay soils and lower than 20 mg Mg /kg for the
sand soils.</p>

<p>Below the same example but then visualised for a series of soils with
a MG-CC values ranging from 0 to 75 mg Mg per kg for one soil with land
use grassland. From this example one can see that the soil health index
score varies from very low to very high, depending on the content of
MG-CaCl2 (mg Mg/kg), and deficiency symptions will occur when Mg-CaCl2
values decrease below 20 mg Mg/kg.</p>

distinghuising sandy (Arenoso), loamy (Franco) and clayey (Arcilloso)
soils, but this is not (yet) implemented in the agronomic evaluation of
Mg availability. Information on the threshold values for Mg occupation
in view of sustainable crop production has been derived by the
fertilizer guidelines handbook entitled “PRÁCTICA DE LA FERTILIZACIÓN
RACIONAL DE LOS CULTIVOS EN ESPAÑA”. This book is online available <a href="https://www.mapa.gob.es/dam/mapa/contenido/agricultura/publicaciones/01_fertilizacion-baja-.pdf" class="external-link">here</a>.</p>
<p>Note that IACS crop codes for Spain are available in

<p>Below an example is visualized how the soil health index varies in
relation to variation in the CEC occupation with magnesium. The optimum
soil Mg threshold value for sustainable crop production is around
15-20%. Magnesium deficiency symptoms occur when the occupation degree
drops down to 6.5%.</p>

<p>The supply of Mg for arable fields as well as grassland fields on
sandy soils is directly related to the plant available Mg-content
(measured with CaCl2-extraction). The Mg supply is subsequently
evaluated with a more-is-better logistic response curve derived from the

Mg-supply is indirectly quantified based on Mg content in the grass (for
intake by cows), which was predicted by a empirically derived regression
model of CEC, organic matter content, clay content, pH, as well as the K
availability assessed by K-CaCl2 and K-CEC. Subsequently, the Mg supply
is evaluated based on the difference between the predicted Mg and the

<code>osi_crops</code> package table.</p>
<p>Below an example is visualized how the soil health index varies in
relation to variation in Mg-CaCl2. The optimum soil Mg threshold value
for sustainable crop production is around 80 mg Mg/ kg, and the soil
index decreases when Mg-CaCl2 values decreases. Magnesium deficiency
occurs when Mg-CaCl2 is below 40 mg /kg for the clay soil and below the
18 mg Mg / kg for the sandy soil, given the fixed CEC and Mg and K
occupation of the CEC as well. There is no differentiation among land
uses.</p>

<p>The magnesium supply in view of soil health for agricultural soils in
Sweden can be calculated using <code>osi_c_magnesium_se</code> using the
following inputs:</p>
<ul>
<li>B_LU, being the crop code, an unique number for each crop</li>
<li>A_MG_AL, being the extracted Mg content with ammonium lactate
extraction, unit mg Mg / kg</li>
</ul>
<p>The Mg supplying capacity differs per land use type. The threshold
values for optimum crop production were derived from the fertilizer
guidelines <a href="https://webbutiken.jordbruksverket.se/sv/artiklar/jo219.html" class="external-link">“Rekommendationer
för gödsling och kalkning 2025”</a>.</p>
<p>Note that IACS crop codes for Sweden are available in
<code>osi_crops</code> package table.</p>
<p>Below an example is visualized how the soil health index varies in
relation to variation in Mg-AL. The soil health assessment does not
differentiate (yet) between crop types and has an optimum threshold
around 10 mg Mg / kg. Magnesium deficiency occurs when the Mg-AL values
decrease below 3 mg Mg / kg (to be checked).</p>

<p>The magnesium supply in view of soil health for agricultural soils in
Slovak Republic can be calculated using <code>osi_c_magnesium_sk</code>
using the following inputs:</p>
<ul>
<li>B_LU, being the crop code, an unique number for each crop</li>
<li>B_TEXTURE_HYPRES, being the soil texture class according to HYPRES
classification system</li>
<li>A_MG_M3, being the extracted Mg content with Mehlich-III extraction,
unit mg Mg / kg.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Mg supplying capacity differs in soils with varying textures.
Based on the soil mineralogy (clay, sand and silt content) one can
easily classify the USDA texture class using
<code>osi_get_TEXTURE_HYPRES</code>. Information on the threshold values
for Mg-Mehlich in view of sustainable crop production has been derived
from Fotyma et al. (2008) who wrote a comprehensive overview of soil
testing methods in Eastern Europe entitled “Soil testing methods and
fertilizer recommendations in Central–Eastern European countries”.</p>
<p>Note that IACS crop codes for Slovak Republic are available in
<code>osi_crops</code> package table.</p>
<p>Below an example is visualized how the soil health index varies in
relation to variation in Mg-M3. The optimum soil Mg threshold value for
sustainable crop production is around 250 mg Mg/ kg for the clay soil
and is around 150 - 200 mg Mg / kg for the loam and sandy soil. The soil
index rapidly decreases when Mg-M3 values decreases. Magnesium
deficiencies occur when Mg-M3 goes down to 100 mg Mg / kg for the sandy
soil and down to 175 mg Mg / kg for the clay soil.</p>

<p>The magnesium supply in view of soil health for agricultural soils in
Slovenia can be calculated using <code>osi_c_magnesium_sl</code> using
the following inputs:</p>
<ul>
<li>B_LU, being the crop code, an unique number for each crop</li>
<li>B_TEXTURE_HYPRES, being the soil texture class according to HYPRES

</ul>
<p>The Mg supplying capacity differs in soils with varying textures.
Based on the soil mineralogy (clay, sand and silt content) one can
easily classify the USDA texture class using
<code>osi_get_TEXTURE_HYPRES</code>.The Mg supplying capacity does not
differ among crop types; there is a single optimum threshold defined.
Information on the threshold values for Mg-AL in view of sustainable
crop production has been derived from Fotyma et al. (2008) who wrote a
comprehensive overview of soil testing methods in Eastern Europe
entitled “Soil testing methods and fertilizer recommendations in
Central–Eastern European countries”.</p>
<p>Note that the crop codes for Slovenia are not yet available in
<code>osi_crops</code> package table.</p>
<p>Below an example is visualized how the soil health index varies in
relation to variation in Mg-AL. The optimum soil Mg threshold value for
sustainable crop production is around 125 mg Mg/ kg for the three soil
types evaluated (clay, sand and loam). Magnesium deficiency occurs at
Mg-AL values around 40 (sand and loam) and 65 (clay) mg Mg / kg.</p>

<p>The magnesium supply in view of soil health for agricultural soils in
United Kingdom can be calculated using <code>osi_c_magnesium_uk</code>
using the following inputs:</p>
<ul>
<li>B_LU, being the crop code, an unique number for each crop</li>
<li>A_MG_AN, being the extracted Mg content with ammonium nitrate, unit
mg Mg / kg</li>
<li>A_SOM_LOI, being the organic matter content, unit in percentage (%),
being used to convert the A_MG_AN to the Mg-index classification system
used in the UK.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Mg supplying capacity differs among soil textures, but in the UK
the evaluation of the Mg supply is similar for all soil types but it
varies for grassland and crop land. Information on the threshold values
for Mg levels in soil in view of sustainable crop production can be
found on <a href="https://ahdb.org.uk/knowledge-library/rb209-section-1-principles-of-nutrient-management-and-fertiliser-use" class="external-link">the
website of AHDB</a>. A more detailed table can be found <a href="https://www.alsenvironmental.co.uk/media-uk/pdf/datasheets/contaminated-land/defra-index-scale_td_uk_2017.pdf" class="external-link">here</a></p>
<p>Note that the crop codes for the UK are not yet available in
<code>osi_crops</code> package table.</p>
<p>Below an example is visualized how the soil health index varies in
relation to variation in K-AN. The optimum soil Mg threshold value for
sustainable crop production is around 60 mg Mg/ kg. Differences among
crops are small. Magnesium deficiency occurs when the Mg-AN value
decreases below around 25 mg Mg / kg.</p>
