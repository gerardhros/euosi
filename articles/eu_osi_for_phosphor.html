</h2>
<p>Phosphorus (P) is an essential nutrient for crops and is applied to
agricultural soil to bring or keep the soil at a certain target soil P
status in view of an optimal crop yield. As such the P supply is a key
aspect of soil health. Phosphorus in soil can be present as organic and
inorganic P, with inorganic P typically contributing between 35 and 70%
to total soil P. For soils receiving long-term inputs of P fertilizers
and animal manures, the contribution of inorganic P to total soil P
usually increases, as inorganic P is abundant in animal manures.
Inorganic P includes phosphate sorbed to reactive soil particles (such
as amorphous Fe- and Al-(hydr)oxides and oxidic clay mineral edges) and
phosphate-bearing minerals. In the normal pH range of 5 to 8 of most
agricultural soils, P sorption is the major mechanism controlling the P
concentration in soil solution. The extent to which soils can sorb P
depends on the maximum P sorption capacity which for non-calcareous
soils relates to the amorphous Fe- and Al-(hydr)oxides contents.</p>
<p>Assessments of the soil health in view of phosphorus usually follow
the agronomic Build-Up and Maintenance approach, where measured soil P
contents are used to classify the soil P status, which is used to derive
the best P fertilizer strategy for a specific crop. With this approach,
all agricultural soils ultimately reach a “target” soil P status being
optimal for crop produciton. Currently, this target soil P status is
determined by the economic optimization of crop yield at which the P
fertilizer inputs equals crop P removal, although some countries
recommend adding additional P to correct for “inevitable” P losses
caused by a progressive shift of plant-available P to less available
soil P forms and environmental P losses. The target soil P status
currently corresponds to the P status at which over 90% of relative crop
yield is achieved. This target soil P status is derived from long-term P
fertilization experiments.</p>
<p>Routine agronomic soil P tests have in common that they make use of
extraction methods to determine a certain fraction of total soil P that
is correlated to crop response. The extracted amount of P varies with
the nature of the extraction solution and methodological factors such as
soil pretreatment, the soil-to-solution ratio and the analytical
technique used for P measurement. For measuring readily available P
forms that can be taken up by the crop in the short-term, soil P tests
(referred to as P intensity methods) such as the 0.01 M CaCl2 and the
water extraction method can be used. For the measurement of labile or
moderately strong bound P (referred to as P quantity methods),
extractions with acid ammonium acetate-lactate (P-AL), Mehlich3 and
sodium bicarbonate (P-Olsen) can be used.</p>
<p>The European Open Soil Index assesses the soil function for P supply
using the agronomic knowledge base as being used in the various EU
countries. The soil P supply is transformed into an unitless indicator
score ranging between zero (poor quality) and one (optimum quality).
This indicator score reflects the ‘distance to target’ (i.e. difference
between the current and optimum situation, while ensuring that other
soil functions are not limiting). The further it deviates from score 1,
the poorer the soil function works. An indicator value of 0.5
approximately corresponds to the threshold level of the fertilization
guidelines under which (additional) fertilization is recommended (given
the ‘buildup and maintenance’ approach as being implemented in
fertilizer recommendation systems). Overall, the indicator value can be
interpreted as good (&gt;0.75), sufficient (0.5-0.75), and poor
(&lt;0.5).</p>

<p>In euso package has a wrapper function to assess the soil health
index for the soil P supply in agricultural soils across Europe. The
wrapper function is <code>osi_c_phosphor</code> and has the following
inputs:</p>
<ul>

<li>A_CLAY_MI (numeric) The clay content of the soil (%)</li>
<li>A_SAND_MI (numeric) The sand content of the soil (%)</li>
<li>A_SOM_LOI (numeric) The organic matter content of the soil (%)</li>
<li>A_C_OF (numeric) The organic carbon content in the soil (g C /
kg)</li>
<li>A_PH_WA (numeric) The pH measured in water.</li>
<li>A_PH_CC (numeric) The pH measured in CaCl2 extraction.</li>
<li>A_CACO3_IF (numeric) the percentage of CaCO3 (%)</li>
<li>A_P_AAA (numeric) The exchangeable P-content of the soil measured

<li>A_P_AL (numeric) The P-content of the soil extracted with ammonium
lactate (mg P / kg)</li>
<li>A_P_CAL (numeric) The exchangeable P-content of the soil measured
via Calcium Ammonium Lactate (mg P/ kg)</li>
<li>A_P_CC (numeric) The P-content of the soil extracted with CaCl2 (mg

<li>B_COUNTRY (character) The country code</li>
</ul>
<p>Not all the inputs are mandatory. The function runs with the soil
parameters being available for LUCAS. Other soil P extraction methods
can be added, but when unknown, then these are estimated from P-Olsen
using published pedotransferfunctions, using the function
<code>osi_conv_phosphor</code>. Similarly, helper functions are applied
to estimate <code>A_C_OF</code>, <code>A_PH_KCL</code> and
<code>A_PH_WA</code>.</p>
<p>The wrapper function wraps country specific P assessment functions.
These are illustrated and described in this vignette per country, sorted

<ul>
<li>B_LU, being the crop code, an unique number for each crop</li>
<li>A_P_CAL, being the extracted P content with calcium ammonium

<p>The soil P threshold for optimum soil health is generic for all soil
types but differs between arable land and grassland. The optimum
threshold is set around 47-68 mg P/kg for grassland and around 47-111 mg
P/kg for cropland. More information can be found in the article of
Bohner et al. (2013), that can be downloaded <a href="https://raumberg-gumpenstein.at/jdownloads/Forschungsberichte/Umweltressourcen_im_Gruenland/Naehrstoffe/2_2013_INTERREG_IV_Projekt_Abschlussbericht_gewaesserzukunft_Bohner.pdf" class="external-link">here</a>

codes with the string “grass” are considered as grassland whereas all
others are considered cropland.</p>
<p>The optimum soil P threshold is around 60 mg P/kg and actually not
different between both land uses. P deficiency symptoms start to occur
when the P-CAL becomes lower than 30 mg P/kg.</p>

easily classify the USDA texture class using
<code>osi_get_TEXTURE_USDA</code>.</p>
<p>Note that the crop codes for Finland are not yet available in
<code>osi_crops</code> package table.</p>
<p>Below an example is visualized how the soil health index varies in
relation to variation in P-AAA for four soil types. The differences
between the soil types is rather small. The optimum soil P threshold
value for sustainable crop production is around 25 mg P/ kg for the four
soil types evaluated (clay, sand,loam and peat), and the soil index
decreases when P-AAA values decreases down to 5 mg P/kg.</p>

<p>In France, soil phosphorus status for crop production is determined
by assessing plant-available phosphorus levels, using the Olsen
excration method. This soil P pool is then compared against thresholds
specific to different crops, which vary based on factors like soil type
and climate. In France the P supply can be assessed with varying degree
of detail depending on the availability of regional threshold values.
More information of the optimum threshold values and the soil P status
evaluation can be found <a href="https://comifer.asso.fr/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/COMIFER_RAPPORT_fertilisation_15102019.pdf" class="external-link">here</a>.</p>
<p>The euosi package the soil health score for P supply can be
calculated with <code>osi_c_phosphor_fr</code>, requiring the following
inputs:</p>
<ul>
<li>B_LU, being the French crop code, an unique code for each crop</li>
<li>A_P_OL, being the extracted P content with Olsen method, unit mg P
/kg.</li>
<li>A_PH_WA, being the soil acidity measured in water.</li>
</ul>
<p>The soil pH is used to distinghuish between calcareous and
non-calcareous soils. If not given, then the function assumes the soil
is not calcareous.</p>
<p>If one likes to adress the regional differences, it is also possible
to add the agroeconomic region in France (argument
<code>B_AER_FR</code>) and the agricultural soil type (argument
<code>B_SOILTYPE_AGR</code>). These two arguments are optional. There
are 40 soil types that can be selected (see below for the exact types
possible).</p>

<p>The phosphorus supply for grassland and maize fields is quantified
based on soil P reserves (determined with ammonium lactate extraction)
and plant available P (determined with CaCl2 extraction), where the
optimum P supply is derived from multiple field experiments across the
Netherlands. For arable fields, the phosphorus supply is approximated
with water-extractable P, which reflect P availability controlled by
chemical sorption and desorption equilibria and affected by the iron and
aluminum oxides content of soils. The P supply is evaluated with a
more-is-better logistic scoring function, which reaches the maximum
score when the phosphorus supply is around 4.8 (unitless index, for
maize and grassland fields) and 45 (mg P2O5 per liter, for arable
fields). More information for grasland and maize can be found <a href="www.bemestingsadvies.nl">here</a> and for arable crops can be

unit mg P /kg.</li>
</ul>
<p>The P supplying capacity differs in soils with varying textures.
Based on the soil mineralogy (clay, sand and silt content) one can
easily classify the USDA texture class using
<code>osi_get_TEXTURE_HYPRES</code>. Information on the threshold values
for P-Mehlich in view of sustainable crop production has been derived
from Fotyma et al. (2008) who wrote a comprehensive overview of soil
testing methods in Eastern Europe entitled “Soil testing methods and
fertilizer recommendations in Central–Eastern European countries”.</p>
<p>Note that the crop codes for Slovak Republic are not yet available in
<code>osi_crops</code> package table.</p>
<p>Below an example is visualized how the soil health index varies in
relation to variation in P-M3. The optimum soil P threshold value for
sustainable crop production is around 150 mg P/ kg for the three soil
types evaluated (clay, sand and loam), and the soil index rapidly
decreases when P-M3 values decreases down to 50-70 mg P/kg, with the
quickest decline for the sandy soils (low in buffering capacity).</p>

</h2>
<p>The phosphorus supply in view of soil health for agricultural soils
in Slovenia can be calculated using <code>osi_c_phosphor_sl</code> using
the following inputs:</p>
<ul>
<li>B_LU, being the crop code, an unique number for each crop</li>
<li>A_P_AL, being the extracted P content with Ammonium Lactate
extraction, unit mg P/kg.</li>
</ul>
<p>The P supplying capacity does not differ among soil types or crop
types; there is a single optimum threshold defined for all agricultural
land. Information on the threshold values for P-AL in view of
sustainable crop production has been derived from Fotyma et al. (2008)
who wrote a comprehensive overview of soil testing methods in Eastern
Europe entitled “Soil testing methods and fertilizer recommendations in
Central–Eastern European countries”.</p>
<p>Note that the crop codes for Slovenia are not yet available in
<code>osi_crops</code> package table.</p>
<p>Below an example is visualized how the soil health index varies in
relation to variation in P-AL. The optimum soil P threshold value for
sustainable crop production is around 80 mg P/ kg for the three soil
types evaluated (clay, sand and loam), and the soil index rapidly
decreases when P-AL values decreases down to 30 mg P/kg.</p>

<p>The phosphorus supply in view of soil health for agricultural soils
in United Kingdom can be calculated using <code>osi_c_phosphor_uk</code>
using the following inputs:</p>
<ul>
<li>B_LU, being the crop code, an unique number for each crop</li>
<li>A_P_OL, being the extracted P content with the Olsen method, unit mg
P /kg</li>
<li>A_SOM_LOI, being the organic matter content, unit in percentage (%),
being used to convert the P-Olsen to the P-index classification system
used in the UK.</li>
</ul>
<p>The P supplying capacity differs among soil textures, but in the UK
the evaluation of the P supply is similar for all soil types but it
varies for grassland and crop land. Information on the threshold values
for P-Olsen in view of sustainable crop production can be found on <a href="https://ahdb.org.uk/knowledge-library/rb209-section-1-principles-of-nutrient-management-and-fertiliser-use" class="external-link">the
website of AHDB</a>. A more detailed table can be found <a href="https://www.alsenvironmental.co.uk/media-uk/pdf/datasheets/contaminated-land/defra-index-scale_td_uk_2017.pdf" class="external-link">here</a></p>
<p>Note that the crop codes for the UK are not yet available in
<code>osi_crops</code> package table. For now, the B_LU code is used to
differentiate between vegetables and non-vegetables.</p>
<p>Below an example is visualized how the soil health index varies in
relation to variation in P-Olsen. The optimum soil P threshold value for
sustainable crop production is around 15 mg P/ kg for grassland and
around 25 for potato crop. Phosphorus deficiency occurs when the P-OL
value decreases below around 7.5 to 15 mg P/kg.</p>
