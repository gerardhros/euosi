</h3>
<p>Potassium (K) is a vital macronutrient for both soil health and plant
nutrition. In soil, it plays a role in nutrient availability and water
retention, while in plants, it’s crucial for numerous physiological
processes, impacting growth, development, and overall health. Potassium
is one of the 16 plant essential nutrients and is responsible for
several critical physiological and metabolic functions of the plant,
including photosynthesis, transpiration, water and nutrient
translocation, and disease susceptibility through enzyme regulation.
Adding sufficient K for plant uptake can provide the host plant with
either an advantage or disadvantage in disease susceptibility, depending
on the pathogen and the situation.</p>
<p>ffective management of potassium (K) nutrition begins with
understanding the amount of plant-available K in the soil solution, how
it interacts with other K forms, the potential loss pathways, and any K
inputs from organic or inorganic fertilizers. Although K is often
considered an immobile nutrient due to its positive charge and
attraction to cation exchange sites, its actual mobility and
availability depend on whether it is in the soil solution or the
exchangeable K pool, as well as the soil’s moisture content.</p>
<p>Potassium in the soil solution is the only mobile and immediately
available form for plants, representing roughly 0.02% to 2% of the total
soil K. Exchangeable K, while not mobile, can be released from cation
exchange sites into the soil solution, making up about 1% to 3% of total
K. The vast majority—around 95% to 98%—exists in insoluble forms bound
within soil minerals, making it unavailable to plants. Over long
periods, weathering gradually releases K from these minerals into more
available forms. Certain microorganisms can also enhance K availability
from the mineral pool by producing organic acids that solubilize
mineral-bound K, increasing its accessibility for plant uptake.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://gerardhros.github.io/euosi/">European Open Soil
Index</a> assesses the soil function for K supply using the agronomic
knowledge base as being used in the various EU countries. The soil K
supply is transformed into an unitless indicator score ranging between
zero (poor quality) and one (optimum quality). This indicator score
reflects the ‘distance to target’ (i.e. difference between the current
and optimum situation, while ensuring that other soil functions are not
limiting). The further it deviates from score 1, the poorer the soil
function works. An indicator value of 0.5 approximately corresponds to
the lower threshold level of the fertilization guidelines under which
(additional) fertilization is recommended (given the ‘buildup and
maintenance’ approach as being implemented in fertilizer recommendation
systems). Overall, the indicator value can be interpreted as good
(&gt;0.75), sufficient (0.5-0.75), and poor (&lt;0.5).</p>

can be added, but when unknown, then these are estimated from K-AAA
using published pedotransferfunctions, using the function
<code>osi_conv_potassium</code>. Similarly, helper functions are applied
to estimate <code>A_C_OF</code>,<code>A_PH_WA</code>, and
<code>A_CEC_CO</code> when value is missing (i.e. NA_real_).</p>
<p>Note that the IACS crop codes codes have been added to the
<code>osi_crops</code> package table from version 0.4.0 onwards. The
crop codes are only present for the countries AT, BE, BG, CZ, DE, DK,
ES, FI, FR, IT, NL, PT, SE, and SK.</p>
<p>The wrapper function wraps country specific K assessment functions.
These are illustrated and described in this vignette per country, sorted

</h3>
<p>The potassium supply in view of soil health can be calculated using
<code>osi_c_potassium_at</code> using the following inputs:</p>
<ul>
<li>B_LU, being the crop code, an unique number for each crop</li>
<li>A_K_CAL, being the extracted K content with calcium ammonium
lactate, unit mg K /kg.</li>
<li>B_TEXTURE_HYPRES, being the soil texture class according to HYPRES

</ul>
<p>The K supplying capacity differs in soils with varying textures.
Based on the soil mineralogy (clay, sand and silt content) one can
easily classify the HYPRES texture class using
<code>osi_get_TEXTURE_HYPRES</code>.</p>
<p>The soil K threshold for optimum soil health is in Austria generic
for all soil types but differs between arable land and grassland. The
optimum threshold is set around 47-68 mg K/kg for grassland and around
47-111 mg K/kg for cropland. More information can be found in the
article of Bohner et al. (2013), that can be downloaded <a href="https://raumberg-gumpenstein.at/jdownloads/Forschungsberichte/Umweltressourcen_im_Gruenland/Naehrstoffe/2_2013_INTERREG_IV_Projekt_Abschlussbericht_gewaesserzukunft_Bohner.pdf" class="external-link">here</a>

<p>Note that the IACS crop codes codes have been added to the
<code>osi_crops</code> package table in version 0.4.0.</p>
<p>The optimum soil K threshold is around 150 mg K/kg whereas occurance
of K deficiencies might vary depending on soil type. Potassium
deficiency symptoms start to occur when the K-CAL becomes lower than 100
mg K/kg for the clay soils and lower than 50 mg K/kg fr the sand
soils.</p>

cropland or grassland with a higher optimum threshold value for
grassland than cropland. Also soil type affects the K supply. More
information of the optimum threshold values and the soil K status
evaluation can be found in the IFA report entitled
<code>POTASSIUM AND MAGNESIUM FERTILISER RECOMMENDATIONS IN SOME EUROPEAN COUNTRIES</code>.</p>

<p>Below the same example but then visualised for a series of soils with
a K-AAA value ranging from 0 to 200 mg K per kg for two soils (S = sand,
P = loam) and land use grassland. From this example one can see that the
soil health index score varies from very low to very high, depending on
the content of K-AAA (mg K/kg), and deficiency symptions will occur when
K-AAA values decrease below 80-100 mg K/kg.</p>

<p>The potassium supply in view of soil health for agricultural soils in

<li>B_LU, being the crop code, an unique number for each crop</li>
<li>B_TEXTURE_HYPRES, being the soil texture class according to HYPRES

</ul>
<p>The K supplying capacity differ for soils varying in clay content,
and the soil health assessment differs with the texture class,
distinghuising sandy (Arenoso), loamy (Franco) and clayey (Arcilloso)
soils. Information on the threshold values for K-AAA in view of
sustainable crop production has been derived by the fertilizer
guidelines handbook entitled “PRÁCTICA DE LA FERTILIZACIÓN RACIONAL DE
LOS CULTIVOS EN ESPAÑA”. This book is online available <a href="https://www.mapa.gob.es/dam/mapa/contenido/agricultura/publicaciones/01_fertilizacion-baja-.pdf" class="external-link">here</a>.</p>
<p>Note that IACS crop codes for Spain are available in
<code>osi_crops</code> package table.</p>
<p>Below an example is visualized how the soil health index varies in
relation to variation in K-AAA. The optimum soil K threshold value for
sustainable crop production is around 300 mg K/ kg for the three soil
types. The soil index decreases more stronger on the clay soils, in
particular when K-AAA values drop down to 140 mg K/kg. For the sand soil
the K availability remains quite high down to 75 mg K/kg.</p>

<p>In France, soil potassium status for crop production is determined by
assessing plant-available K levels, using the acid ammonium acetate
excration method. This soil K pool is then compared against thresholds
specific to different crops, which vary based on factors like soil type
and climate. In France the K supply can be assessed with varying degree
of detail depending on the availability of regional threshold values,
similar to that for phosphorus. More information of the optimum
threshold values and the soil K status evaluation can be found <a href="https://comifer.asso.fr/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/COMIFER_RAPPORT_fertilisation_15102019.pdf" class="external-link">here</a>.</p>

<li>A_K_AAA, being the extracted K content with ammonium acetate
extraction, unit mg K /kg.</li>
<li>A_PH_WA, being the soil acidity measured in water.</li>
</ul>
<p>The soil pH is used to distinghuish between calcareous and
non-calcareous soils. If not given, then the function assumes the soil
is not calcareous.</p>
<p>If one likes to adress the regional differences, it is also possible
to add the agroeconomic region in France (argument
<code>B_AER_FR</code>) and the agricultural soil type (argument
<code>B_SOILTYPE_AGR</code>). These two arguments are optional. There

<p>Below the same example but then visualised for various soil types
with a K-AAA value ranging from 0 to 300 mg K per kg for a potato crop.
From this example one can see that the soil health index score varies
from very low to very high, depending on the content K-AAA (mg K/kg).
Optimum threshold values are found for K-AAA values around 350 mg K/kg,
with no differences between limon and argileux soil types, and with
bigger risks for K deficiencies for the loam and clay soils (i.e. lower
scores are observed already at K-AAA levels of around 200 mg K/kg).</p>

over different K pools in soil, which are regulated by sorption and
desorption processes, the cation exchange capacity of the soil, and
competing ions in soil solution and at the exchange complex. Building
upon agronomic research done in last decades, the K supply is quantified
based on the plant available K fraction (measured via CaCl2-extraction,
K-CaCl2) and the CEC for grasslands, K-CaCl2 for maize fields, and
K-CaCl2, CEC, clay content, organic matter content and soil pH for
arable fields. The K supply is evaluated with the more-is-better

<p>The potassium supply in view of soil health for agricultural soils in
Norway can be calculated using <code>osi_c_potassium_no</code> using the
following inputs:</p>
<ul>
<li>B_LU, being the crop code, an unique number for each crop</li>
<li>A_CLAY_MI, being the clay content, in units percentage (%)</li>
<li>A_K_AL, being the extracted K content with ammonium lactate
extraction, unit mg K /kg</li>
</ul>
<p>The K supplying capacity differs among soil textures, but here the
evaluation of the K supply is similar for all land uses.The Norwegian
fertilizer documentation has not been retreived yet, and information of
the optimum threshold values and the soil K status evaluation was
retreived from the IFA report entitled
<code>POTASSIUM AND MAGNESIUM FERTILISER RECOMMENDATIONS IN SOME EUROPEAN COUNTRIES</code>.
Additional information is retreived from the <a href="https://www.nibio.no/tema/jord/gjodslingshandbok/korreksjonstabeller/kaliumkorreksjon-til-eng" class="external-link">website
from NIBIO</a>.</p>
<p>Note that the crop codes for Norway are not yet available in
<code>osi_crops</code> package table.</p>
<p>Below an example is visualized how the soil health index varies in
relation to variation in K-AL. The optimum soil K threshold value for
sustainable crop production is around 150 mg K/ kg, and there is no
distinction between soil types. Potassium deficiency occurs when the
K-AL value decreases below around 75 mg K/kg.</p>

<p>The potassium supply in view of soil health for agricultural soils in
Poland can be calculated using <code>osi_c_potassium_pl</code> using the
following inputs:</p>
<ul>
<li>B_LU, being the crop code, an unique number for each crop</li>
<li>B_TEXTURE_HYPRES, being the soil texture class according to HYPRES
classification system</li>
<li>A_K_DL, being the extracted K content with Double Lactate

</ul>
<p>The K supplying capacity differ for soils varying in clay content,
and the soil health assessment differs with the texture class,
distinghuising sandy (C), loamy (M) and clayey (F) soils, for example.
One can easily classify the HYPRES texture class using
<code>osi_get_TEXTURE_HYPRES</code> when clay, sand and silt content are
known.</p>
<p>Information on the threshold values for K-DL in view of sustainable
crop production has been derived from Fotyma et al. (2008) who wrote a
comprehensive overview of soil testing methods in Eastern Europe
entitled “Soil testing methods and fertilizer recommendations in
Central–Eastern European countries”.</p>
<p>Note that the crop codes for Poland are not yet available in
<code>osi_crops</code> package table.</p>
<p>Below an example is visualized how the soil health index varies in
relation to variation in K-DL for three soil types. The optimum soil K
threshold value for sustainable crop production is strongly dependent on
soil type, ranging from around 75 mg K/kg for sandy soils up to 150 mg
K/kg for clayey and loamy soils. Potassium deficiencies range
accordingly between 35 and 100 mg K/kg.</p>
