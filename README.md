The Open Soil Index (OSI) is a method to evaluate the quality of soils of agricultural fields and the sustainability of the current agricultural practices.
The OSI score is based on four main criteria: chemical, physical, biological and management. 
This package is the European implementation of the Dutch Open Bodem Index Calculator (OBIC). 
By providing results of a soil analysis and management info the 'euosi' package can be use to calculate the scores, indicators and derivatives that are used to evaluate soil quality.

The current R package is still in development. If you want to contribute, please contact the main developers Gerard Ros or Elise van Eynde.
