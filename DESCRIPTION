Description: The Open Soil Index (OSI) is a method to evaluate the quality of soils of agricultural fields and the sustainability of the current agricultural practices.
    The OSI score is based on four main criteria: chemical, physical, biological and management. This package is the European implementation of the Dutch Open Bodem Index Calculator (OBIC). 
    By providing results of a soil analysis and management info the 'euosi' package can be use to calculate the scores, indicators and derivatives that are used to evaluate soil quality.
    More information about the Open soil Index can be found at <https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.2c04516#>.
