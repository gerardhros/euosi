This document explains how the phosphorus surplus indicator is calculated for each country and provides references


## Netherlands:



## Belgium (Flanders): 

## France:

Principle: High P-Olsen concentrations are negatively evaluated using a logistic regression, by mirorring the logistic function that was used to evaluate the P-olsen in an agronomic context. The P-olsen is evaluated based on (1) the crop needs (high need, moderate need, low need) which is mentioned in the osi_crops table (2) the soil type based on pH measured in water.


See page 25 in reference. !!! Threshold values are given in mg/kg P2O5, conversion is done by =(Treshold/(141.943x10^3))x2x30.97*10^3
