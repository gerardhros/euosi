This document explains how the phosphorus indicator is calculated for each country and provides references


## Netherlands:



## Belgium (Flanders): 

## France:

Principle: The exchangeable potassium is evaluated based on (1) the crop needs (high need, moderate need, low need) which is mentioned in the osi_crops table (2) the region (3) the soil type 

Two thresholds exist     (1) Timp = soil supplies the crop need, above this concentration no fertilizer response
                         (2) Trenf = below this threshold, soil needs to be replenished, fertilizer recommendation > supply 

The logistic function is based on the P Olsen evaluation in comparison with the export by the plant: score 0 when supply = 0; score 1 when supply = export

See page 25 in reference. !!! Threshold values are given in mg/kg K2O5, conversion is done by =(Treshold/(158
1936^3))x2x39.0983*10^3
