This document explains how the phosphorus indicator is calculated for each country and provides references


## Netherlands:



## Belgium (Flanders): 

## France:

Principle: Exchangeable magnesium is evaluated per soil type (CEC, clay, CaCO3), based on table provided by Arvalis (in mg/kg Mg):
my_tbl <- tibble::tribble(
  ~Sand..CEC...3.7.cmol.kg., ~Loess..CEC...7.12.cmol.kg., ~Clay.Calcareous, ~Clay...40...clay..without.CaCO3,
                         30,                          36,               48,                               60
  )

require(knitr)
kable(my_tbl, digits = 3, row.names = FALSE, align = "c",
              caption = NULL)

If Mg levels are lower, fertilization is needed. If Mg levels are higher, fertilization is not needed.
