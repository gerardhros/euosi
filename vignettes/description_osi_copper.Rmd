This document explains how the zinc indicator is calculated for each country and provides references


## Netherlands:



## Belgium (Flanders): 

## France:

Principle:

For all crops, the Cu supply is evaluated based on the Cu measured in EDTA (mg/kg) and Soil organic matter (%) ratio. Below this threshold, fertilization may be needed.
The index was calculated based on these threshold values using a logistic function, and giving score 1 when ratio is higher than the threshold. 

Thresholds depend on soil type: 0.4 for argilo calcaires, 0.5 for limons caillouteux and 1 for limons. We included clay > 50 for clay soils with threshold 0.4, and coarse fragments (which is also in LUCAS database) > 35% for stony soils.
