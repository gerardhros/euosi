This document explains how the pH indicator is calculated for each country and provides references


## Netherlands:



## Belgium (Flanders): 

## France:

Principle:

The pH indicator is calculated based on pH measured in H2O. Different low threshold values are used per soil and crop type: loam (L, Lsa, LAS, La and LL in French GEPPA) with sugarbeet > 7, sandy soils (SS, Sl, S, L, Sal, Sa) any crop > 5.5, loam (L, Lsa, LAS, La and LL) with any other crop > 6.5, others = 5.8 - 6.8 is optimal
