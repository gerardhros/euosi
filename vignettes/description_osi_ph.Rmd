This document explains how the pH indicator is calculated for each country and provides references


## Netherlands:



## Belgium (Flanders):

Principle:

The pH indicator is calculated based on pH measured in H2O. Different low threshold values are used per soil and crop type: loam with sugarbeet > 7, sandy soils any crop > 5.5, loam with any other crop > 6.5, others = 5.8 - 6.8 is optimal
