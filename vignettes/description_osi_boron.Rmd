This document explains how the boron indicator is calculated for each country and provides references


## Netherlands:



## Belgium (Flanders): 

## France:

Principle:

For sunflower, rapeseed and faba beans (feverole), the B supply is evaluated based on the B measured in hot water (mg/kg). Below this threshold, fertilization may be needed.
The index was calculated based on these threshold values using a logistic function, and giving score 1 when concentration is higher than the threshold. 

Thresholds depend on soil type: 1.2 for argilo calcaires, 0.8 for other soils. We included clay > 50 for clay soils with threshold 1.2 and 0.8 for other soils.
